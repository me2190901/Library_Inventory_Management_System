    AUTOMATING LIBRARY BOOK INVENTORY MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS USING SUPERVISED DEEP LEARNING.
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>In this age of modernization, physical libraries are still an integral part of education system. A library can house lakhs of books and, managing and updating book inventory for such a huge citadel  is very tedious task. If we deploy a team of 4-5 people to perform this task it will took a month for them to finish that completely.  
        Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence  is the new and powerful tool to tackle cumbersome processes as evolving day by day. There are many pre-existing model present in the market which are capable to perform inventory management but are very slow and are limited by book spine segmentation and off-the shelf OCR systems. Most of these models suffers from image distortion when they have to segment handcrafted features. 
        We will build a model which is very efficient and can segment every kind of book based on their text represented on the cover.
        </p>
